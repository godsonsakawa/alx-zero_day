# 0x03. Git
My first repository alx project! In this project, completed on my zero-day at ALX, I was introduced to Git and GitHub; specifically, I started practicing creating repositories, commiting, pushing code, creating and merging branches, pulling updates, and working as a collaborator.

## Contents
* `bash`: A directory containing the files `alx`, `school` and `98`.
* `c`: A directory containing the file `c_is_fun.c`.
* `up_to_date`: A file containing the git command to update a local repository from GitHub.
* `.gitignore`: A file that defines a rule to never push `~` files.
